                Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a tabletop role-playing game where players
                create characters and tell a story together. One player, called the
                Dungeon Master (DM), controls the world and the challenges.

                Each player controls a character with a class such as Fighter, Wizard,
                Rogue, or Cleric. Your class determines what abilities and powers your
                character has.

                Players describe what they want to do, and dice are rolled to determine
                success or failure. The most important die is the 20-sided die (d20).
